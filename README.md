# Compiler Final Project
In this final project, your goal is to craft a Mini-LISP interpreter. All resources you need are on the LMS, including the language specifications, a standard interpreter (called smli) and some Mini-LISP program examples for testing. Since you have learnt lex and yacc, itâ€™s good to use these tools to build your project, but you are allowed to use other languages and tools for this project.
  
Your tasks are to :  
    1. Read the language specifications of Mini-LISP.  
    2. Read and run Mini-LISP program examples to understand the language behavior.  
    3. Write an interpreter for Mini-LISP, implement features of the language.  

* How to run the standard interpreter?
  `$ ./smli example.lsp`
